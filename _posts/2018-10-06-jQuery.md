#### 导入

```Js
<script src="file/jquery.js"></script>
```

it gives a library of commands that you can use to do things

#### $ sign

Dollar sign is the value that\`s given to the jQuery library when it loads up. So anytime you want to reference jQuery you hit dollar

#### document ready function

```Js
<script>
	$(document).ready(function(){
        
	});
</script>
```

1. Your jQuery code always goes inside of a document ready function.
2. you can have multiple document ready functions, there is no need to if you just have a few lines of code but they\`re not going to conflict what this does, says "hey, wait for my whole document to load up before I try running any JavaScript."
3. Short way of doing it, they are the same thing.

```Js
<script>
	$(function(){
        
	});
</script>

```
#### fun part

you have two part to each jQuery action.

1. Selector which works just like CSS, you can use single quotes or double quotes.
2. Then give it dot and give it your method

```html
<div>
	<div id="panel1">
		#panel1
	</div>
</div>
```

```Js
<script>
	$(function(){
		$("#panel1").hide(); // because it`s id is panel 1
		//$("#panel1").hide(300); hide over the course of 300 milliseconds 
		//$("#panel1").hide(300).show(1000); you can keep chaining it as long 

	});
</script>
```

#### hide 300 milliseconds

```Js
<script>
	$(function(){
		$("#panel1").hide(300); // hide over the course of 300 milliseconds 
	});
</script>
```

#### keep chaining

```Js
<script>
	$(function(){
		$("#panel1").hide(300).show(1000); // you can keep chaining it as long as it`s not the semicolon yet
		//$("#panel1").hide(300).show(1000).hide(300).show(1000).hide(300).show(1000);
	});
</script>
```

#### slide up
