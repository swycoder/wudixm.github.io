### Eureka Tuturial

[原文]()

**@EnableEurekaService annotation will enable the eureka server, this is the only thing we have to do to enable one eureka server which remember it is a microservice that holds a service registry meaning that it keeps a list of the available eureka clients and this enable us to use the microservice architecture.**

### SPRING INITIALIZR

[website](https://start.spring.io/)

#### Eureka server

1. search **Eureka server**

2. Generate Project

3. add `@EnableEurekaServer` to spring boot class

4. application.properties file

   ```properties
   server.port=8761
   spring.application.name=eureka-server
   eureka.client.registerWithEureka=false
   eureka.client.fetchRegistry=false
   ```

#### Zuul

1. search **Acturator, Zuul, Eureka Discovery**

2. Generate Project

3. add `@EnableZuulProxy` to spring boot class, because **we want this microservice to be a Zuul proxy**

4. add `EnableDiscoveryClient` to spring boot class, **it will register to eureka server as a eureka client**

5. application.yml file

   ```
   server:
     port: 8762
   spring:
     application:
       name: zuul-server

   eureka:
     instance:
       preferIpAddress: true
     client:
       registerWithEureka: true
       fetchRegistry: true
     serviceUrl:
       defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/     # eureka/
   ```

#### Rest App

1. search **Actuator, Web, Eureka Discovery**

2. Generate Project

3. add `EnableDiscoveryClient` to spring boot class

   ```java
   @EnableEurekaClient   //you are tied to the Eureka from Netflix dependency
   @EnableDiscoveryClient  // technology independent, so it works with Eureka, it may work with other implement as well
   ```

### Zuul Route Rules

**application.yml. **

```
 zuul:
  ignoredServices: '*'
  routes:
    users: /myusers/**
```

In the preceding example, all services are ignored, **except** for `users`.

To augment or change the proxy routes, you can add external configuration, as follows:

**application.yml. **

```
 zuul:
  routes:
    users: /myusers/**
```

The preceding example means that HTTP calls to `/myusers` get forwarded to the `users` service (for example `/myusers/101` is forwarded to `/101`).

To get more fine-grained control over a route, you can specify the path and the serviceId independently, as follows:

**application.yml. **

```
 zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      serviceId: users_service
```

The preceding example means that HTTP calls to `/myusers` get forwarded to the `users_service` service. The route must have a `path` that can be specified as an ant-style pattern, so `/myusers/*` only matches one level, but `/myusers/**` matches hierarchically.

The location of the back end can be specified as either a `serviceId` (for a service from discovery) or a `url` (for a physical location), as shown in the following example:

**application.yml. **

```
 zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      url: http://example.com/users_service
```

These simple url-routes do not get executed as a `HystrixCommand`, nor do they load-balance multiple URLs with Ribbon. To achieve those goals, you can specify a `serviceId` with a static list of servers, as follows:

**application.yml. **

```
zuul:
  routes:
    echo:
      path: /myusers/**
      serviceId: myusers-service
      stripPrefix: true

hystrix:
  command:
    myusers-service:
      execution:
        isolation:
          thread:
            timeoutInMilliseconds: ...

myusers-service:
  ribbon:
    NIWSServerListClassName: com.netflix.loadbalancer.ConfigurationBasedServerList
    listOfServers: http://example1.com,http://example2.com
    ConnectTimeout: 1000
    ReadTimeout: 3000
    MaxTotalHttpConnections: 500
    MaxConnectionsPerHost: 100
```

Another method is specifiying a service-route and configuring a Ribbon client for the `serviceId` (doing so requires disabling Eureka support in Ribbon — see [above for more information](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/multi/multi_spring-cloud-ribbon.html#spring-cloud-ribbon-without-eureka)), as shown in the following example:

**application.yml. **

```
zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      serviceId: users

ribbon:
  eureka:
    enabled: false

users:
  ribbon:
    listOfServers: example.com,google.com
```

You can provide a convention between `serviceId` and routes by using `regexmapper`. It uses regular-expression named groups to extract variables from `serviceId` and inject them into a route pattern, as shown in the following example:

**ApplicationConfiguration.java. **

```
@Bean
public PatternServiceRouteMapper serviceRouteMapper() {
    return new PatternServiceRouteMapper(
        "(?<name>^.+)-(?<version>v.+$)",
        "${version}/${name}");
}
```

The preceding example means that a `serviceId` of `myusers-v1` is mapped to route `/v1/myusers/**`. Any regular expression is accepted, but all named groups must be present in both `servicePattern` and `routePattern`. If `servicePattern` does not match a `serviceId`, the default behavior is used. In the preceding example, a `serviceId` of `myusers` is mapped to the "/myusers/**" route (with no version detected). This feature is disabled by default and only applies to discovered services.

To add a prefix to all mappings, set `zuul.prefix` to a value, such as `/api`. By default, the proxy prefix is stripped from the request before the request is forwarded by (you can switch this behavior off with `zuul.stripPrefix=false`). You can also switch off the stripping of the service-specific prefix from individual routes, as shown in the following example:

**application.yml. **

```
 zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
      stripPrefix: false
```

| ![[Note]](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/multi/images/note.png) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `zuul.stripPrefix` only applies to the prefix set in `zuul.prefix`. It does not have any effect on prefixes defined within a given route’s `path`. |

In the preceding example, requests to `/myusers/101` are forwarded to `/myusers/101` on the `users` service.

The `zuul.routes` entries actually bind to an object of type `ZuulProperties`. If you look at the properties of that object, you can see that it also has a `retryable`flag. Set that flag to `true` to have the Ribbon client automatically retry failed requests. You can also set that flag to `true` when you need to modify the parameters of the retry operations that use the Ribbon client configuration.

By default, the `X-Forwarded-Host` header is added to the forwarded requests. To turn it off, set `zuul.addProxyHeaders = false`. By default, the prefix path is stripped, and the request to the back end picks up a `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header (`/myusers` in the examples shown earlier).

If you set a default route (`/`), an application with `@EnableZuulProxy` could act as a standalone server. For example, `zuul.route.home: /` would route all traffic ("/**") to the "home" service.

If more fine-grained ignoring is needed, you can specify specific patterns to ignore. These patterns are evaluated at the start of the route location process, which means prefixes should be included in the pattern to warrant a match. Ignored patterns span all services and supersede any other route specification. The following example shows how to create ignored patterns:

**application.yml. **

```
 zuul:
  ignoredPatterns: /**/admin/**
  routes:
    users: /myusers/**
```

The preceding example means that all calls (such as `/myusers/101`) are forwarded to `/101` on the `users` service. However, calls including `/admin/` do not resolve.

| ![[Warning]](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/multi/images/warning.png) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| If you need your routes to have their order preserved, you need to use a YAML file, as the ordering is lost when using a properties file. The following example shows such a YAML file: |

**application.yml. **

```
 zuul:
  routes:
    users:
      path: /myusers/**
    legacy:
      path: /**
```

If you were to use a properties file, the `legacy` path might end up in front of the `users` path, rendering the `users` path unreachable.
